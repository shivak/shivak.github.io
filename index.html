<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I work on computational and statistical methods at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare (as described <a href="#current">below</a>). I graduated from the Ph.D. program at <a href="https://csd.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon's Computer Science Department</a>. My <a href="http://reports-archive.adm.cs.cmu.edu/anon/2024/abstracts/24-137.html">thesis</a> developed syntheses between classical and modern machine learning techniques which achieved "best of both worlds" results in terms of safety and accuracy. My advisor was the razor-sharp, incredibly-patient <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ggordon/">Geoff Gordon</a>. Earlier, I earned an M.S. under <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~satya/">Mahadev Satyanarayanan</a> on the topic of human-in-the-loop machine learning. I was fortunate to spend time at Microsoft Research under <a href="https://dennyzhou.github.io/">Denny Zhou</a> developing statistical learning theory for hierarchical classifiers.

<h2 id="current">Current work on meta-analysis</h2>
<p>I am designing a system which answers questions about healthcare interventions in a rigorous, comprehensive manner. "Rigorous" requires meaningful, falsifiable guarantees about how well the causal effect is estimated. "Comprehensive" means using as much data as possible. Unfortunately, the two dominant paradigms for answering such questions &mdash; language models in artificial intelligence, and meta-analysis in medicine &mdash; don't have these properties. Language models don't enjoy correctness guarantees; meanwhile, to preserve their causal rigor, meta-analyses are restricted solely to randomized controlled trials. The solution is a careful fusion of these approaches which I call <em><a href="papers/conformal-meta.pdf">conformal meta-analysis</a></em>. 

<figure>
  <img src="conformal-meta.png" />
  <figcaption>This answers the question comprehensively by involving both randomized trials and observational data. Even if the latter are confounded, the resulting predictions are supported by rigorous correctness guarantees. See <a href="papers/conformal-meta.pdf">the paper</a> for more details.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Multiple research groups and I are collaborating to achieve this vision. 
<ul>
<li>An important baseline question to ask is: how well is meta-analysis currently working in evidence-based medicine? Along with <a href="https://www.sunlab.org/">Jimeng Sun</a> and <a href="https://zifengwang.xyz/">Zifeng Wang</a> at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, I am performing a large-scale empirical assessment of the predictive value of meta-analysis. Besides being interesting in its own right, this will establish a baseline for conformal meta-analysis to surpass.  
<li>Along with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vEIMoZEAAAAJ">Rae Woong Park</a> and <a href="https://kr.linkedin.com/in/min-gyu-kim">Min-Gyu Kim</a> at Ajou University, I am reconducting various meta-analyses with the aid of electronic health record data from South Korea's integrated hospital network. We believe conformal meta-analysis will deliver superior results in these applications.  
<li>In addition to these empirical projects, I am continuing to develop new statistical methodology as well. Soon, <a href="https://www.mayamathur.com">Maya Mathur</a> (at Stanford University) and I will examine how meta-analytic prediction intervals must change to account for publication bias and related meta-scientific issues.

<p>I am the creator and maintainer of the Rust CLI tool <tt>mky</tt>. Based on the same cryptographic infrastructure as passkeys, <tt>mky</tt> allows you to sign, encrypt, and verify messages using unphishable secret keys embedded on your mobile phone. (Like a Yubikey would, but you don't have to pay $50, carry it around, and worry about losing it). This means more secure <tt>ssh</tt>, <tt>scp</tt>, <tt>git</tt> commit signing, and <tt>age</tt> encryption &mdash; all in one easy-to-use bundle available on Linux, Mac, and Windows.</p> 

<p>I make some effort to push changes and fixes upstream. For example, I'm working on some new deployment features for <a href="https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/pull/2852">Bun</a> and <a href="">uWebSockets</a>. I've merged small fixes to <a href="https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/543">OpenSSH</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ryantm/agenix/pull/176">agenix</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/207736">various</a> <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/209368">NixOS</a> packages, <a href="https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq/pull/181">torchdiffeq</a>, <a href="https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch/pull/344">torch</a>, <a href="https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch/pull/344">torch7</a>, etc.
